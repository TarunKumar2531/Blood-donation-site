    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Blood Connect was founded with a simple goal: to bridge the gap between people in critical need of blood and generous, voluntary donors.</p>
    <h3>Why Donate?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Every two seconds, someone in the world needs blood.</li>
        <li>A single donation can save up to three lives.</li>
        <li>It is a safe, simple, and essential process.</li>
    </ul>
