# 🩸 Blood Connect: A Basic Web Development Project

## Project Overview

*Blood Connect* is a simple, 4-page static website designed to connect potential blood donors with individuals or facilities urgently needing specific blood types. This project was developed as a submission for a first-year college Web Development course, focusing strictly on foundational web technologies.

*Goal:* To demonstrate proficiency in structuring a multi-page site using core HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

| Technology | Role | File Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *HTML5* | Provides the core content structure for all pages. | *.html files |
| *External CSS* | Handles all styling, layout, colors, and typography. | css/style.css |
| *External JavaScript* | Adds basic client-side interactivity (alerts, form handling). | js/script.js |

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a clean, organized directory structure:# Blood-donation-site
## ✨ Site Features

The website contains the required four distinct pages, each with its own purpose:

1.  **Home (index.html):**
    * Introduction to the mission.
    * Call-to-action button linked to a basic JavaScript alert function (displayAlert()).
2.  **Search (search.html):**
    * Allows users to select a blood type and enter a location.
    * Uses JavaScript (handleSearch()) to simulate finding results and provide conditional messages (e.g., highlighting the need for O-).
3.  **Register (register.html):**
    * A form for users to register as a Donor or Receiver.
    * Uses JavaScript (handleRegistration()) for basic client-side validation (10-digit phone number check) and confirmation alerts.
4.  **About (about.html):**
    * Details the mission, the importance of blood donation, and contact information.

## 💡 Implementation Highlights

* *External Linking:* All CSS and JavaScript are successfully linked externally, keeping the HTML clean.
* *Semantic HTML:* Used structural elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, and <form>.
* *Basic Form Handling:* Demonstrated ability to capture form data and prevent default submission using JavaScript.
* *Consistent Styling:* Applied a consistent, blood-themed color palette (reds, whites, and dark grays) across all pages using the single external stylesheet.

## 🛠 How to Run the Project

1.  *Clone or Download:* Download the entire blood-donation-site folder to your computer.
2.  *Open:* Navigate to the folder and double-click the index.html file.
3.  *Browser:* This will open the Home page in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). You can navigate between pages using the links in the header.
